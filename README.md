## Why this exists

In 2017 the industry quietly killed 3D. Blu-ray players stopped shipping it, TVs dropped it, and the software that could play **3D Blu-rays** — encoded in a format called **MVC** — was discontinued one app at a time. The discs didn't disappear. The collections didn't disappear. The *players* did.

And here's the cruel part: **MVC can't be played by the tools everyone already has.** When you rip a 3D Blu-ray to an MKV, you get an H.264 stream carrying **two interleaved camera views** — left and right eye, the second view encoded as differences against the first. FFmpeg — the engine inside VLC, MPC-HC, and nearly every "it plays everything" player — **decodes only the base view and silently throws the 3D away.** You get a flat 2D picture and no warning. The depth is *in the file*. Nothing on your machine will show it to you.

**SyLC 3D Player is the answer to that problem.** It is a complete, from-scratch stereoscopic pipeline — its own MVC decoder, its own demuxer, its own HDR renderer — built over months specifically so that your 3D library plays again, in full quality, on modern hardware. It is **free, open-source, and unencumbered**. No license, no activation, no trial, no telemetry.

As far as we know, it is **the only actively-developed, open-source player that truly decodes MVC** — both eyes — and renders it in real HDR.

## What makes it unique

- 🧬 **It doesn't lean on FFmpeg for the hard part.** The 3D is decoded by a custom in-house H.264/**MVC** decoder that reconstructs *both* views — the thing mainstream players can't do.
- 🌈 **True HDR, not a tone-mapped fake.** Frames land in a 16-bit-float **scRGB** Direct3D 11 swapchain; a GPU shader does YUV→RGB and the stereo frame-packing in one pass. HDR10/PQ is preserved end to end.
- 🥽 **Real 3D output.** Frame-packed stereo to a detached window for 3D TVs, projectors and HMDs — plus an embedded 2D preview.
- 🎯 **Pixel-exact.** The decoder's luma output has been verified byte-for-byte against FFmpeg's base view. It's not "close enough" — it's correct.
- 🪶 **Self-contained.** One executable (x64) or one portable folder (ARM64). Nothing to install, no codec packs, no system pollution.

## Under the hood

For the curious, here is what is actually happening between the file and your eyes — and why each step was hard enough to be interesting.

### 1. The decoder — `edge264`, taught to see in stereo
The heart of the player is **[edge264](https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264)**, a remarkable single-translation-unit H.264 decoder with hand-written SIMD kernels — **SSE2→AVX2** on x86, **NEON** on ARM. It is fast, lean, and BSD-licensed. But like everything else, it spoke only 2D.

This project extends it into a real **MVC (Annex H)** decoder: a second *dependent* view that predicts itself from the *base* view across the inter-view boundary, a per-view **decoded-picture-buffer** that has to honour `max_dec_frame_buffering` *separately* for each eye, SPS↔Subset-SPS fallback, PPS inheritance, frame-pairing, and graceful buffer-overflow handling so the two eyes never drift apart. Getting two interdependent H.264 bitstreams to march in lockstep, frame for frame, is most of the engineering.

### 2. The demuxer — pulling two eyes out of one container
A dedicated **C++ demuxer** (pybind11, on top of **libmatroska/libebml**) opens the MKV, finds the MVC track, and de-interleaves the base and dependent NAL units into the exact order the decoder expects — feeding a zero-copy ring buffer so decode never waits on I/O.

### 3. The renderer — HDR all the way to the panel
Decoded YUV planes are uploaded straight to the GPU. A Qt **RHI / Direct3D 11** shader converts colour and assembles the stereo frame inside an **RGBA16F (scRGB)** HDR surface — the format Windows uses for native HDR — so there is no SDR round-trip and no OpenGL→DXGI copy tax.

### 4. The real-time problem — and the Python GIL
Audio rides on **libmpv**; video is slaved to mpv's clock so the two stay locked. But MVC decode is **single-threaded** (the multiview decoder isn't thread-safe), which makes timing brutal: decoding a single key frame can take ~100 ms, and on a naïve loop that froze the picture once per GOP — a visible hitch every second. The fix was to **decouple presentation from decoding** (a dedicated presenter thread with back-pressure so the buffer absorbs the spikes) and then to wrestle the **CPython GIL** itself — `sys.setswitchinterval(0.0005)` was the decisive change that stopped the decode thread from starving the presenter. Result on a dense scene: **16 fps with 33 % dropped frames → a steady 24 fps with zero drops.**

---

## War stories

Months of work hide inside a few one-line fixes. A taste:

- **The "Frankenstein" banding.** *Gravity* and other demanding discs came out sliced with horizontal bands of wrong colour. The cause was buried deep in dequantization: when a picture declared a scaling matrix but supplied no lists and the sequence had none either, the decoder fell back to a **flat-16** matrix instead of the **H.264 default** matrices the spec mandates. One wrong fallback, an entire film corrupted. Fixed in the PPS parser.
- **The decoder that worked everywhere but Windows.** Every slice failed with `EBADMSG`. The culprit: Windows' `<windows.h>` defines `min`/`max` as **macros**, which silently replaced edge264's own inline `min`/`max` and made the **CABAC** arithmetic diverge bit-for-bit. The fix is three characters — `NOMINMAX` — and finding it took considerably longer than typing it.
- **The deadlock between two eyes.** Under load the per-view buffers could wedge against each other; it took an entry-guard bypass, a graceful frame-bump path, and a force-complete with chroma concealment to guarantee the stereo pair always advances.

This is the kind of work that doesn't show up in a feature list — but it's the difference between "plays MVC" and *plays MVC correctly, every frame, on every disc.*

## Two native builds — no emulation

| Platform | Asset | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows x64** | `SyLC_3D_Player_v3.0_win-x64.exe` | Single self-contained file. Built for the **x86-64-v3 (AVX2)** baseline — runs natively on any AVX2 CPU (Haswell 2013+ / Zen 1+). |
| **Windows on ARM** | `SyLC_3D_Player_v3.0_win-arm64.zip` | Portable folder, **100 % native ARM64** (Snapdragon / Adreno) — every binary cross-compiled to aarch64, zero x64 emulation. |

The decoder's SIMD hot loop is compiled for each architecture's vector unit (AVX2 / NEON), so you get the real silicon, not a translation layer.

---

## System requirements

- **Windows 10/11 (x64)** or **Windows 11 on ARM (ARM64)**.
- A **Direct3D 11**-capable GPU (an HDR display to enjoy HDR).
- x64: a CPU with **AVX2** (standard since ~2013).
- Input: an **MKV** containing an **MVC** track. Rip a 3D Blu-ray with **MakeMKV**. (Plain 2D files play through libmpv.)

> Raw `.ssif` / `.m2ts` Blu-ray structures aren't supported yet — remux to MKV first.

---

## Get started

1. Download the asset for your platform from **Releases** (including the dlls if you plan to use the sources).
2. **x64:** run `SyLC_3D_Player_v3.0_win-x64.exe`. **ARM64:** unzip and run `SyLC_3D_Player.exe`.
3. Open a 3D MKV (drag-and-drop or the folder button). Send the frame-packed window to your 3D display and enjoy.

Nothing to install. Everything — decoder, demuxer, audio, codecs, Python runtime — is bundled.

---

## Build from source

Everything needed lives in this repository: the Python application, the **decoder sources** (`edge264/`), the **demuxer sources** (`mvc_realtime_demuxer/`), the binaries, and the build scripts. Full details in **[`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md)** (x64) and **`BUILD_ARM.md`** (ARM64).

The short version (x64):

```bat
:: edge264 decoder (MSYS2 / UCRT64) — portable AVX2 build
gcc -shared -o edge264.dll -O3 -march=x86-64-v3 -flax-vector-conversions edge264/src/edge264.c -lpthread

:: one-file no-console executable (Nuitka + MSVC 2022)
build_exe_onefile.bat
```

Prerequisites: **Python 3.13**, `pip install -r requirements.txt` + `nuitka` + `pybind11`, **MSVC 2022**, and **MSYS2/GCC** for edge264. Swap `-march=x86-64-v3` for `-march=znver3` (or `native`) if you're building only for your own machine and want every last drop of Zen 3.
